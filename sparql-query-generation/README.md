# SPARQL Query Generation Using Federated Knowledge Graphs

## Description
This project involves developing SPARQL queries from natural language using federated knowledge graphs. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance accuracy and reduce hallucinations in query generation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SPARQL
- Ontology (VoIDs, ShEx)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Key Features
- Embeddings-based similarity search
- Query validation using endpoint schemas
- Metadata utilization from knowledge graphs
- Documentation and testing
